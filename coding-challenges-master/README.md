# Coding Challenges

A collection of coding challenges to gain insight into the programming skills of our peers.
If you have any questions feel free to contact us.


## Doing the challenges

Every challenge is contained in its separate folder and includes a readme file with instructions on how to solve it.

Before you begin changing files, initialize a Git repository in the `coding-challenges` folder and create an initial commit. This way, way can submit a patch file to us later.

```
$ cd coding-challenges/ && git init && git add -A && git commit -m "init"
```


## Submitting your results

Commit and squash all your changes and use Git to create a patch file:

```
$ git diff > patch.txt
```

Make sure that all of your changes are contained in the patch file.

Send us the patch via Email.

- We value coding practices like clear naming, consistent syntax, and sensible comment usage.
- We are here to help. If you're stuck don't hesitate to contact us.
